# [Minesweeper (Java)]

This is a simple a Minesweeper game in Java that I learned to code through online instruction!
 This game of Minesweeper was created in Java using the awt and swing graphics library. 
 I created a graphical user interface (GUI) to display a 8x8 grid of tiles. The 
 functionality behind the game was set so that with a left click, the tile is opened 
 and detected for a mine. If there is no mine, the program will count the number of 
 mines surrounding the tile by recursively checking neighboring tiles. With a right 
 click, mine flags can be placed and removed from a tile. Mines are generated randomly 
 and the number of mines in the game is displayed at the top.
